  text: 'I’m a fullstack developer looking for a new role in an exciting company. I focus on writing accessible HTML, using modern CSS practices and writing clean JavaScript. When writing JavaScript code, I mostly use React, but I can adapt to whatever tools are required. I’m based in Spain, but I’m happy working remotely and have experience in remote teams. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me outdoors and exercising. I’d love you to check out my work.',
